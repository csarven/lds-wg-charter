            <h2>Scope</h2>

            <p>
                With the increase in the usage of Linked Data (a.k.a. RDF Datasets) for a variety of applications, there is a need to be able to verify the authenticity and integrity of Linked Data. Such features are important for the ability to sign documents like
                <a
                    href="@@@">Verifiable Credentials</a>, to ensure the integrity of governmental Open Data set or of RDF statements added to a knowledge graphs, or to prove the origin and authenticity of an <a href="@@@@">OWL</a> ontology used to make deductions on
                    public datasets. Technically, what is needed is the ability to provide <em>cryptographic, digital signature</em> of <a href="@@@@">RDF Datasets</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Signing a RDF Dataset <span class='rdf'>R</span> involves several steps, namely:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Use a <em>canonicalization</em> function on <span class='rdf'>R</span>, yielding <span class='rdf'>C(R)</span>, such that:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span class='rdf'>C(R)</span> is a representation (e.g., a serialization) of an RDF Dataset that is <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-dataset-isomorphism'>isomorphic</a> to <span class='rdf'>R</span>&#x2009;;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            if <span class='rdf'>R</span> and <span class='rdf'>R'</span> are <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-dataset-isomorphism'>isomorphic</a> RDF Datasets, then <span class='rdf'>C(R) = C(R')</span>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Apply a cryptographic signature function on <span class='rdf'>C(R)</span>.</li>
                <li>
                    Express the result of the signature function as separate RDF Graph <span class='rdf'>S</span>, providing information on the exact canonicalization and cryptographic signature functions used in the previous steps.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                <em>The scope of this Working Group is define a Standard for each of the three steps above</em>. This includes RDF vocabularies for expressing the results of the signatures, representing and referencing the various possible signature functions,
                and standard ways of serializing this vocabulary in various RDF serialization formats (e.g., providing standard <a href='@@@@'>JSON-LD context</a> files for a JSON-LD serialization.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that, although RDF Datasets can be represented easily in an <em>almost</em> canonical form using a serialization in <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/'>N-quads</a>, the existence of <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-blank-nodes'>Blank Nodes</a>                makes the definition of a full canonicalization function much more difficult. (See, for example, the introduction of the <a href="http://aidanhogan.com/docs/rdf-canonicalisation.pdf">paper of Adrian Hogan</a> for a more thorough description
                of the mathematical challenges.) It is only in recent years that a solution to the canonicalization problem has been solved. <em>One of the major goals of this Working Group is to provide, based on recent research results, a Standard canonicalization algorithm.</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Note also that a standard canonicalization algorithm can be used for different purposes, not only for Linked Data signatures. For example, calculating whether the RDF datasets <span class='rdf'>R<sub>1</sub></span> and <span class='rdf'>R<sub>2</sub></span>                are isomorphic may be done by checking whether <span class='rdf'>C(R<sub>1</sub>)=C(R<sub>2</sub>)</span>. Although the main goal of the Working Group is to provide a framework for signing Linked Data, these types of applications will
                also be taken into account.
            </p>

            <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a>                of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
            <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
            <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>


            <p>
                <To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have

        <section id="coordination">
            <h2>Coordination</h2>
            <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant
                Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of each specification.
                The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

            <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

            <p>
                To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification
                Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
            </p>
            <p>
                The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

            <p id="public">
                Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public
                review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository
                and may permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
            </p>
            <p>
                Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="">Linked Data Signatures Working Group home page.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Most Linked Data Signatures Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.

                This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a href="[link to Github repo]"><i class='todo'>GitHub issues</i></a>. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

                Decision Policy
            </h2>
            <p>
                This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial
                proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
            <p>
                However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
            </p>
            <p>
                To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions
                (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week to 10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections
                are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
            </p>
            <p>
                All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
            </p>
            <p>
                This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
