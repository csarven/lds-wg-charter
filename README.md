# Proposed Charter for a Linked Data Signatures Working Group

Any text in this repository should be considered as _a draft of a draft_. The process to get to a charter is:

1. (completed) agreement among the authors of the charter for a first public version;
2. (completed) transfer this repo to W3C so that it becomes more 'official';
3. (completed) discuss the charter with the W3C strategy team as part of an internal review;
4. (completed) release the charter to the AC as an "advance notice";
5. (in progress) gather community input and seek consensus to evolve and finalize the charter;
6. submit the charter for approval to the W3C management;
7. submit the text to an official review by the AC of W3C.

The [properly rendered version](https://w3c.github.io/lds-wg-charter/) is also available.
