# Proposed Charter for a Linked Data Signatures Working Group

Any text in this repository should be considered as _a draft of a draft_. The process to get to a charter is:

1. (completing) have a broad agreement among the authors of the charter on the content;
2. (completed) transfer this repo to W3C so that it becomes more 'official';
3. discuss the charter with the W3C strategy team as part of an internal review, and, in parallel, release the text to the AC as an "advance notice";
4. submit the text to an official review by the AC of W3C.

At this point, we are in the process of achieving (1) and have achieved (2)â€¦

The [properly rendered version](https://w3c.github.io/lds-wg-charter/) is also available.
